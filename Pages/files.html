<h3 dir="auto">TRUMP &amp; EPSTEIN: TIMELINE &amp; DEEP BACKGROUND</h3>
<p dir="auto"><strong>late 70s</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Through Roy Cohn, Trump gained access to Manhattan’s drug-fueled 
disco scene which featured trafficked women and children. He is quoted 
as saying <em><a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/6/1578544/-The-Untold-Story-of-Trump-Model-Management-A-Daily-Kos-Exclusive-Part-1" rel="noopener nofollow">“I would watch supermodels getting screwed, well-known supermodels getting screwed, on a bench in the middle of the room.”</a></em></li>
<li>Trump and Casablanca would cross paths at some point during the mid 
70’s through Roy Cohn. Casablancas’ influence on Trump becomes obvious 
when <a href="https://xcancel.com/opdeatheaters/status/1163151354581229568" rel="noopener nofollow">reading about both men</a></li>
<li>John Casablancas, founder of Elite Model Management, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/former-model-claims-lawsuit-she-was-raped-teenager-agency-executive-n1276818" rel="noopener nofollow">prolific child rapist, and trafficker</a>. He later became Ivanka Trump’s manager, was a close associate of Trump, and <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/6/1578544/-The-Untold-Story-of-Trump-Model-Management-A-Daily-Kos-Exclusive-Part-1" rel="noopener nofollow">sat on the board of Trump Realty Brazil (2004)</a>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><em>Fun fact</em>: Father of Julian Casablancas of the Strokes. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Casablancas" rel="noopener nofollow">Divorced Julian’s mother when he was “dating” a 16 year old. Married a 17 year old when he was 50 and Julian was 14</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jessica Leeds said that in the late 70s when she was a travelling 
businesswoman she had sat beside Trump, whom she had never met before, 
in the first-class cabin of a flight to New York. She alleged that about
 45 minutes after takeoff Trump lifted the armrest, grabbed her breasts 
and tried to put his hand up her skirt. Leeds alleged Trump’s “hands 
were everywhere”, describing them as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/10/donald-trump-accuser-jessica-leeds" rel="noopener nofollow">“like an octopus”.</a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>early 80s</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>NaKina Carr, a runway model for Oscar de la Renta, in the early 
1980s said: [B]ackstage in the models’ dressing room at one of his 
fashion shows … She was getting ready when all of a sudden she heard 
someone shout, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/14/teen-models-powerful-men-when-donald-trump-hosted-look-of-the-year" rel="noopener nofollow">“Put
 your robes on, here he comes!” “[… Trump] was gropey … he had his hands
 in the most inappropriate places, always. [… But i]f you’re over 
twenty-one, you don’t have to worry.”</a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>late 80s</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Cathleen, a 15-year-old Swedish model, represented by Casablancas’ Elite Model Management <a href="https://imgur.com/0nxh5Ea" rel="noopener nofollow">said she met Trump in the mid-1980s at a party:</a>
 “We had [agency parties] all the time, and [Trump] was there. I had no 
idea who he was,” she told us. “He came in with two girls from the 
agency and sat down at the other end to me. One of them was a Polish 
model. She must have been sixteen, seventeen, definitely no older than 
eighteen. He was all over her. Kissing her on her lips and neck and 
touching her.” [emphasis added] Cathleen said there were about four men 
at the dinner and about six models aged between fifteen and twenty — and
 that there was nothing unusual in that. “This happened every week,” she
 said of the dinners with older men. “You just have to show up…”</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>1989:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Trump and Robert Maxwell, the Czechoslovak-born owner of London’s Daily Mirror tabloid and Ghislaine’s father, <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/21/jeffrey-epstein-trump-clinton-1424120" rel="noopener nofollow">rubbed shoulders on the high-flying Manhattan party circuit</a>.</li>

<li>An Elite model, named Barabara Pilling, said: Trump asked her out 
for dinner in the summer of 1989 […] She recalls Trump asking how old 
she was. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/14/teen-models-powerful-men-when-donald-trump-hosted-look-of-the-year" rel="noopener nofollow">“I said 17 and he said, ‘That’s just great — you’re not too old, not too young.’</a></li>

 into Elite’s Look of the Year competition uncovered allegations from

<li>Shawna Lee, then a 14-year-old <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/14/teen-models-powerful-men-when-donald-trump-hosted-look-of-the-year" rel="noopener nofollow">recalls how the contestants were encouraged to parade downstairs, one by one, and dance for Trump, Casablancas and others</a>.</li>
<li>Another contestant, who was 15 at the time, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/14/teen-models-powerful-men-when-donald-trump-hosted-look-of-the-year" rel="noopener nofollow">also remembers being asked to walk for Trump</a>,
 Casablancas and other men on the boat in September 1992. She says an 
organiser told her that if she refused, she would be excluded from the 
competition. “I knew in my gut it wasn’t right,” she recalls. “This 
wasn’t being judged or part of the competition – it was for their 
entertainment.”</li>

<li>Trump directed Florida businessman George Houraney to organize a 
“calendar girl” competition at Mar-a-Lago, and after 28 female 
contestants were procured, revealed that the other guests were just “him
 and Epstein.”
<ul dir="auto">
<li>“The girls were all decked out, expecting to meet all these VIPs.” 
But after an hour at the party, Houraney says, there seemed to be only 
one other guest: Epstein. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/14/teen-models-powerful-men-when-donald-trump-hosted-look-of-the-year" rel="noopener nofollow">“I
 was like, ‘Donald, where are the guys? What’s going on here?’ And he 
said, ‘Well, this is it.’” Houraney says he realised “this is a Jeff 
Epstein party, basically”.</a></li>
<li>Mr. Houraney’s then-girlfriend and business partner, Jill Harth, 
later accused Mr. Trump of sexual misconduct on the night of the party. 
In a lawsuit, Ms. Harth said that Mr. Trump took her into a bedroom and 
forcibly kissed and fondled her, and restrained her from leaving. She 
also said that a 22-year-old contestant told her that Mr. Trump later 
that night <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/19/us/politics/inside-trump-epstein-friendship.html" rel="noopener nofollow">crawled into her bed uninvited</a>.</li>

 Wilkes says. A Canadian contestant from 1992 recalls similar incidents.

<li>Jeffrey Epstein showed off photos of Donald Trump with <a href="https://lavocedinewyork.com/en/news/2024/11/01/epstein-allegedly-showed-author-pictures-of-trump-with-topless-young-women/" rel="noopener nofollow">“topless young women”</a>
 sitting in his lap, the author Michael Wolff alleged.  Epstein had 
about half a dozen pictures which showed Trump by the pool with multiple
 young women, Wolff claimed on his podcast They were taken in the “late 
90s” at Epstein’s Palm Beach home, where he victimized dozens of 
underage girls along with his procurer, Ghislaine Maxwell.</li>
<li>Even without Epstein, it was pretty much known that Trump would 
ensnare vulnerable underage models via his model agency constructions, 
would invite them to parties at the Plaza Hotel, where they would be 
given drugs and he would then fuck some of them. <a href="https://archive.is/G51zU" rel="noopener nofollow">I quote:</a>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The girls were as young as 15, he says, and “over their heads, they 
had no idea, and they ended up in situations. There were always dramas 
because the men threw money and drugs at them to keep them enticed. It’s
 based on power and dominating girls who can’t push back and can be 
discarded. There’s always someone to pick them back up. Nobody wants to 
call home and say ‘Help me.’”</li>
<li>Trump would “go from room to room,” said the photographer, who added
 that “I was there to party myself. It was guys with younger girls, sex,
 a lot of sex, a lot of cocaine, top-shelf liquor” but no smoking. Trump
 didn’t approve of cigarettes.</li>
<li>Those men at these parties often knew each other. “It’s a small 
community,” the photographer says. “They exchanged information, 
facilitated each other. Trump was in and out. He’d wander off with a 
couple girls. I saw him. He was getting laid like crazy. Trump was at 
the heart of it. He loved the attention and in private, he was a total 
fucking beast.” [12]</li>

1971 to 1977. From 1964 to 1974, Donald was headmaster of the

of sexually assaulting E. Jean Carroll, who accused him of raping her in
 a department store dressing room in the mid-1990s. During a 2022

it, OK?”; and earlier was apparently unable to differentiate his wife at
