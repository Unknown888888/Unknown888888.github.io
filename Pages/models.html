He has claimed that undocumented immigrants are “<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/07/12/donald_trump_in_phoenix_mexicans_are_taking_our_jobs_and_killing_us.html">taking our jobs</a>” and “<a href="http://time.com/4386240/donald-trump-immigration-arguments/">taking our money,</a>”
 pledged to deport them en masse, and vowed to build a wall on the 
Mexican border. At one point he demanded a ban on Muslims entering the 
country. Speaking to supporters in Iowa on Saturday, Trump said he would
 crack down on visitors to the United States who overstay their visas 
and <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-idUSKCN1120SF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared</a>
 that when any American citizen “loses their job to an illegal 
immigrant, the rights of that American citizen have been violated.” And 
he is scheduled to give a major address on immigration in Arizona on 
Wednesday night.</p>
<p>But the mogul’s New York modeling agency, Trump Model Management, has
 profited from using foreign models who came to the United States on 
tourist visas that did not permit them to work here, according to three 
former Trump models, all noncitizens, who shared their stories with <em>Mother Jones</em>. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3035912-Alexia-Palmer-Financial-Ledger-2011-2014.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Financial</a> and <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3035931-Alexia-Palmer-LCA-H1B-Petition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immigration records</a>
 included in a recent lawsuit filed by a fourth former Trump model show 
that she, too, worked for Trump’s agency in the United States without a 
proper visa.</p>
<p>Foreigners who visit the United States as tourists are generally not 
permitted to engage in any sort of employment unless they obtain a 
special visa, a process that typically entails an employer applying for 
approval on behalf of a prospective employee. Employers risk fines and 
possible criminal charges for using undocumented labor.</p>
<p>Founded in 1999, Trump Model Management “has risen to the top of the fashion market,” <a href="http://www.trump.com/entertainment/trump-model-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boasts</a> the Trump Organization’s website, and has a name “that symbolizes success.” According to a <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/05/donald-trump-personal-financial-disclosure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial disclosure</a>
 filed by his campaign in May, Donald Trump earned nearly $2 million 
from the company, in which he holds an 85 percent stake. Meanwhile, some
 former Trump models say they barely made any money working for the 
agency because of the high fees for rent and other expenses that were 
charged by the company. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Canadian-born <a href="http://rachelblais.com/">Rachel Blais</a> 
spent nearly three years working for Trump Model Management. After first
 signing with the agency in March 2004, she said, she performed a series
 of modeling gigs for Trump’s company in the United States without a 
work visa. At <em>Mother Jones</em>‘ request, Blais provided a detailed financial statement from Trump Model Management and a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3035987-Lawyer-Letter-Trump-Models-H1B3-FORDOCCLOUD.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letter</a>
 from an immigration lawyer who, in the fall of 2004, eventually secured
 a visa that would permit her to work legally in the United States. 
These records show a six-month gap between when she began working in the
 United States and when she was granted a work visa. During that time, 
Blais appeared on Trump’s hit reality TV show, <em>The Apprentice</em>, modeling outfits designed by his business protégés. As Blais walked the runway, Donald Trump looked on from the front row.</p>

<p>Two other former Trump models—who requested anonymity to speak freely
 about their experiences, and who we are giving the pseudonyms Anna and 
Kate—said the agency never obtained work visas on their behalf, even as 
they performed modeling assignments in the United States. (They provided
 photographs from some of these jobs, and <em>Mother Jones</em> confirmed with the photographers or stylists that these shoots occurred in the United States.)</p>
<p>Each of the three former Trump models said she arrived in New York 
with dreams of making it big in one of the world’s most competitive 
fashion markets. But without work visas, they lived in constant fear of 
getting caught. “I was pretty on edge most of the time I was there,” 
Anna said of the three months in 2009 she spent in New York working for 
Trump’s agency.</p>
<p>“I was there illegally,” she said. “A sitting duck.”</p>
<p>According to three immigration lawyers consulted by <em>Mother Jones</em>,
 even unpaid employment is against the law for foreign nationals who do 
not have a work visa. “If the US company is benefiting from that person,
 that’s work,” explained <a href="http://www.lauradevine.com/profile/anastasia-tonello">Anastasia Tonello</a>,
 global head of the US immigration team at Laura Devine Attorneys in New
 York. These rules for immigrants are in place to “protect them from 
being exploited,” she said. “That US company shouldn’t be making money 
off you.”</p>
<p>Two of the former Trump models said Trump’s agency encouraged them to
 deceive customs officials about why they were visiting the United 
States and told them to lie on customs forms about where they intended 
to live. Anna said she received a specific instruction from a Trump 
agency representative: “If they ask you any questions, you’re just here 
for meetings.”</p>
<p>Trump’s campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, declined to answer 
questions about Trump Model Management’s use of foreign labor. “That has
 nothing to do with me or the campaign,” she said, adding that she had 
referred <em>Mother Jones</em>‘ queries to Trump’s modeling agency. <em>Mother Jones</em>
 also sent detailed questions to Trump Model Management. The company did
 not respond to multiple emails and phone calls requesting comment.</p>
<p>“Honestly, they are the most crooked agency I’ve ever worked for, and I’ve worked for quite a few,” said Rachel Blais.</p>
<p>Fashion industry sources say that skirting immigration law in the 
manner that the three former Trump models described was once commonplace
 in the modeling world. In fact, <em>Politico </em><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/melania-trump-immigration-donald-226648">recently raised questions</a>
 about the immigration status of Donald Trump’s current wife, Melania, 
during her days as a young model in New York in the 1990s. (In response 
to the <em>Politico </em>story, Melania Trump said she has “at all times been in compliance with the immigration laws of this country.”)</p>
<p>Kate, who worked for Trump Model Management in 2004, marveled at how 
her former boss has recently branded himself as an 
anti-illegal-immigration crusader on the campaign trail. “He doesn’t 
want to let anyone into the US anymore,” she said. “Meanwhile, behind 
everyone’s back, he’s bringing in all of these girls from all over the 
world and they’re working illegally.”</p>
<p><span>Now 31 years old</span> and out of the modeling business, Blais once appeared in various publications, including <em>Vogue</em>, <em>Elle</em>, and <em>Harpers Bazaar</em>,
 and she posed wearing the designs of such fashion luminaries as 
Gianfranco Ferré, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, and Jean Paul Gaultier. Her 
modeling career began when she was 16 and spanned numerous top-name 
agencies across four continents. She became a vocal advocate for models 
and appeared in a 2011 documentary, <a href="http://girlmodelthemovie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Girl Model</em></a>,
 that explored the darker side of the industry. In a recent interview, 
she said her experience with Trump’s firm stood out: “Honestly, they are
 the most crooked agency I’ve ever worked for, and I’ve worked for quite
 a few.”</p>

<p><strong>Rachel Blais appeared in this <em>Elle</em> fashion spread, published in September 2004, while working for Trump’s agency without a proper visa. </strong>Elle</p>
</div>
<p>Freshly signed to Trump Model Management, the Montreal native 
traveled to New York City by bus in April 2004. Just like “the majority 
of models who are young, [have] never been to NYC, and don’t have 
papers, I was just put in Trump’s models’ apartment,” she said. Kate and
 Anna also said they had lived in this apartment.</p>
<p>“The apartment was like a sweatshop,” said a former Trump model.</p>
<p>Models’ apartments, as they’re known in the industry, are 
dormitory-style quarters where agencies pack their talent into bunks, in
 some cases charging the models sky-high rent and pocketing a profit. 
According to the three former models, Trump Model Management housed its 
models in a two-floor, three-bedroom apartment in the East Village, near
 Tompkins Square Park. <em>Mother Jones</em> is withholding the address 
of the building, which is known in the neighborhood for its model 
tenants, to protect the privacy of the current residents.</p>
<p>When Blais lived in the apartment, she recalled, a Trump agency 
representative who served as a chaperone had a bedroom to herself on the
 ground floor of the building. A narrow flight of stairs led down to the
 basement, where the models lived in two small bedrooms that were 
crammed with bunk beds—two in one room, three in the other. An 
additional mattress was located in a common area near the stairs. At 
times, the apartment could be occupied by 11 or more people.</p>
<p>“We’re herded into these small spaces,” Kate said. “The apartment was like a sweatshop.”</p>
<p>Trump Model Management recruited models <a href="http://www.trumpmodels.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as young as 14</a>.
 “I was by far the oldest in the house at the ripe old age of 18,” Anna 
said. “The bathroom always smelled like burned hair. I will never forget
 the place!” She added, “I taught myself how to write, ‘Please clean up 
after yourself’ in Russian.”</p>
<p>A detailed financial statement provided by Blais shows that Trump’s 
agency charged her as much as $1,600 a month for a bunk in a room she 
shared with five others.</p>
<p>Living in the apartment during a sweltering New York summer, Kate 
picked a top bunk near a street-level window in the hopes of getting a 
little fresh air. She awoke one morning to something splashing her face.
 “Oh, maybe it’s raining today,” she recalled thinking. But when she 
peered out the window, “I saw the one-eyed monster pissing on me,” she 
said. “There was a bum pissing on my window, splashing me in my Trump 
Model bed.”</p>
<p>“Such a glamorous industry,” she said.</p>
<p>Blais, who previously discussed some of her experiences in an interview with <a href="http://www.pri.org/stories/2016-08-12/these-undocumented-workers-aren-t-shadows-they-re-out-catwalk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Public Radio International</a>,
 said the models weren’t in a position to complain about their living 
arrangements. “You’re young,” she remarked, “and you know that if you 
ask too many questions, you’re not going to get the work.”</p>
<p>A detailed financial statement provided by Blais shows that Trump’s 
agency charged her as much as $1,600 a month for a bunk in a room she 
shared with five others. Kate said she paid about $1,200 a 
month—”highway robbery,” she called it. For comparison, in the summer of
 2004, an entire studio apartment nearby was advertised at $1,375 a 
month.</p>
<p>From April to October 2004, Blais traveled between the United States 
and Europe, picking up a string of high-profile fashion assignments for 
Trump Model Management and making a name for herself in the modeling 
world. During the months she spent living and working in New York, Blais
 said, she only had a tourist visa. “Most of the girls in the apartment 
that were not American didn’t have a work visa,” she recalled.</p>

</div>
<p>Anna and Kate also said they each worked for Trump’s agency while 
holding tourist visas. “I started out doing test-shoots but ended up 
doing a couple of lookbooks,” Anna said. (A lookbook is a modeling 
portfolio.) “Nothing huge, but definitely shoots that classified as 
‘work.'”</p>
<p>Employers caught hiring noncitizens without proper visas can be fined
 up to $16,000 per employee and, in some cases, face up to six months in
 prison.</p>
<p>The three former Trump models said Trump’s agency was aware of the 
complications posed by their foreign status. Anna and Kate said the 
company coached them on how to circumvent immigration laws. Kate 
recalled being told, “When you’re stuck at immigration, say that you’re 
coming as a tourist. If they go through your luggage and they find your 
portfolio, tell them that you’re going there to look for an agent.”</p>
<p>Anna recalled that prior to her arrival, Trump agency staffers were 
“dodging around” her questions about her immigration status and how she 
could work legally in the United States. “Until finally,” she said, “it 
came to two days before I left, and they told me my only option was to 
get a tourist visa and we could work the rest out when I got there. We 
never sorted the rest out.”</p>
<p>Arriving in the United States, Anna grew terrified. “Going through 
customs for this trip was one of the most nerve-wracking experiences of 
my life,” she added.&nbsp;“It’s hard enough when you’re there perfectly 
innocently, but when you know you’ve lied on what is essentially a 
federal document, it’s a whole new world.”</p>
<p>“Am I sweaty? Am I red? Am I giving this away?” Anna remembered 
thinking as she finally faced a customs officer. After making it through
 immigration, she burst into tears.</p>
<p>Industry experts say that violating immigration rules has been the 
status quo in the fashion world for years. “It’s been common, almost 
standard, for modeling agencies to encourage girls to come into the 
country illegally,” said Sara Ziff, the founder of the Model Alliance, 
an advocacy group that claimed a major success in 2014 after lobbying 
the New York State legislature to pass a bill <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/24/business/a-new-alliance-steps-up-to-protect-the-next-generation-of-models.html">increasing protections for child models</a>.</p>
<p>Bringing models into the United States on tourist visas was “very 
common,” said Susan Scafidi, the director of Fordham University’s 
Fashion Law Institute. “I’ve had tons of agencies tell me this, that 
this used to happen all the time, and that the cover story might be 
something like ‘I’m coming in for a friend’s birthday,’ or ‘I’m coming 
in to visit my aunt,’ that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>For their part, modeling agencies have complained about the time and 
resources required to bring a foreign model into the country and have 
insisted that US immigration laws are out of step with their fast-paced 
industry. “If there are girls that we can’t get into the United States, 
the client is going to take that business elsewhere,” Corinne Nicolas, 
the president of Trump Model Management, told the <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/weiner-bring-hotties-overseas-article-1.295413" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>New York Daily News</em></a> in 2008. “The market is calling for foreign girls.”</p>
<p>In 2007, a few years before his career imploded in a sexting scandal, former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.) <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2008/06/weiner-bill-looks-out-for-models-010997">sponsored a bill</a>
 that would give models the same kind of work visas that international 
entertainers and athletes receive. The tabloids had a field day­—”Give 
me your torrid, your pure, your totally smokin’ foreign babes,” screamed
 a <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/weiner-bring-hotties-overseas-article-1.295413" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Daily News</em></a> headline—and the effort ultimately failed.</p>
<p>Trump Model Management sponsored only its most successful models for 
work visas, the three former models said. Those who didn’t cut it were 
sent home, as was the case, Blais noted, with many of her roommates.</p>
<p>“It was very much the case of you earn your visa,” Anna said. 
“Essentially, if you got enough work and they liked you enough, they’d 
pay for a visa, but you weren’t about to see a dime before you could 
prove your worth.”</p>
<p>The company eventually secured an H-1B visa for Blais. Such visas 
allow US companies to employ workers in specialized fields. According to
 financial records provided by Blais, the company deducted the costs of 
obtaining a work visa from her earnings. (The agency did not obtain work
 visas for Anna and Kate, who each left the United States after their 
stints with Trump Model Management.)</p>
<p>H-1B visas have been increasingly popular in the high-tech field, and Trump’s companies, including Trump Model Management, have <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-exclusive-idUSKCN0Q62RQ20150802" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used this program extensively</a>
 in the past. But on the campaign trail, Trump has railed against the 
H-1B program and those who he says abuse it. “I will end forever the use
 of the H-1B as a cheap labor program and institute an absolute 
requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and 
immigration program,” Trump <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-statement-h1b-visas">said</a> in March. “No exceptions.”</p>
<p>Nearly three years after signing with Trump’s agency, Blais had 
little to show for it—and it wasn’t for lack of modeling jobs. Under the
 contracts that she and other Trump models had signed, the company 
advanced money for rent and various other expenses (such as trainers, 
beauty treatments, travel, and administrative costs), deducting these 
charges from its clients’ modeling fees. But these charges—including the
 pricey rent that Blais and her roommates paid—consumed nearly all her 
modeling earnings. “I only got one check from Trump Models, and that’s 
when I left them,” she said. “I got $8,000 at most after having worked 
there for three years and having made tens of thousands of dollars.” 
(The <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3035986-Blais-Check-for-DocCloud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check</a> Blais received was for $8,427.35.)</p>
<p>“This is a system where they actually end up making money on the back
 of these foreign workers,” Blais added. She noted that models can end 
up in debt to their agencies, once rent and numerous other fees are 
extracted.</p>
<p>This is known in the industry as “agency debt.” Kate said her 
bookings never covered the cost of living in New York. After two months,
 she returned home. “I left indebted to them,” she said, “and I never 
went back, and I never paid them back.”</p>
<p><span>The experiences the</span> former Trump models related to <em>Mother Jones</em> echo allegations in an ongoing <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3036064-Fashion-Models-Class-Action-Lawsuit-Amended.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">class-action lawsuit</a>
 against six major modeling agencies by nine former models who have 
claimed their agencies charged them exorbitant fees for rent and other 
expenses. One plaintiff, Marcelle Almonte, has alleged that her agency 
charged her $1,850 per month to live in a two-bedroom Miami Beach 
apartment with eight other models. The market rate for apartments in the
 same building ran no more than $3,300 per month, according to the 
complaint. (Trump Model Management, which was initially named in an 
earlier version of this lawsuit, was dropped from the case in 2013, 
after the judge narrowed the number of defendants.) Models “were largely
 trapped by these circumstances if they wanted to continue to pursue a 
career in modeling,” the complaint alleges.</p>

<p>“It is like modern-day slavery” Blais said of working for Trump Model
 Management—and she is not alone in describing her time with Trump’s 
company in those terms. Former Trump model Alexia Palmer, who filed a 
lawsuit against Trump Model Management for fraud and wage theft in 2014,
 has <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/models-lawsuit-donald-trump-agency-dismissed/story?id=37878264">said</a> she “felt like a slave.”</p>
<p>Palmer has alleged that she was forced to pay hefty—sometimes 
mysterious—fees to Trump’s agency. These were fees on top of the 20 
percent commission she paid for each job the company booked. Palmer 
charged that during three years of modeling for Trump’s company, she 
earned only $3,880.75. A New York judge dismissed Palmer’s claim <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-modeling-agency-lawsuit-fraud-appeal-445302">in March</a>
 because, among other reasons, she had not taken her case first to the 
Department of Labor. Lawyers for Trump Model Management called Palmer’s 
lawsuit “frivolous” and “without merit.”</p>
<p>Palmer filed a complaint with the Department of Labor this spring, 
and in August the agency dismissed the case. Palmer’s lawyer, Naresh 
Gehi, said he is appealing the decision. Since he began representing 
Palmer, he said, fashion models who worked for other agencies have 
approached him with similar stories. “These are people that are coming 
out of the closet and explaining to the world how they are being 
exploited,” he said. “They are the most vulnerable.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3035912-Alexia-Palmer-Financial-Ledger-2011-2014.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Documents</a> filed in Palmer’s case indicate that she worked in the United States without a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3035931-Alexia-Palmer-LCA-H1B-Petition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work visa</a> after being recruited by Trump’s agency from her native Jamaica. Gehi declined to discuss his client’s immigration status.</p>

<p><strong>Former Trump model Alexia Palmer posed for this <em>Teen Vogue</em> shoot in January 2011. She secured a work visa in October 2011. </strong>Teen Vogue</p>
</div>
<p>A Caribbean model contest launched Palmer’s career <a href="http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/Pulse-s-Caribbean-Model-Search-continues-tonight_9525218">in 2010</a>,
 and at age 17 she signed an exclusive contract with Trump Model 
Management in January 2011. Department of Labor records show she 
received approval to work in the United States beginning in October 
2011. Yet according to a financial statement filed as evidence in her 
case, Palmer started working in the United States nine months before 
this authorization was granted. Her financial records list a January 22,
 2011, job for Condé Nast, when she posed for a <em>Teen Vogue</em> spread featuring <a href="http://www.teenvogue.com/gallery/boys-of-glee-prom-guide">the cast of <em>Glee</em></a>. (The shoot took place at Milk Studios in Los Angeles.)</p>
<p>“That whole period, from January to September, was not authorized,” 
said Pankaj Malik, a partner at New York-based Ballon, Stoll, Bader 
&amp; Nadler who has worked on immigration issues for over two decades 
and who reviewed Palmer’s case for <em>Mother Jones</em>. “You can’t do any of that. It’s <em>so</em> not allowed.”</p>
<p><span>Trump has taken</span> an active role at Trump Model Management
 from its founding. He has personally signed models who have 
participated in his Miss Universe and Miss USA competitions, where his 
agency staff appeared as judges. Melania Trump was a Trump model for a 
brief period after meeting her future husband in the late 1990s.</p>
<p>“I left with a bad taste in my mouth. I didn’t like the agency. I 
didn’t like where they had us living. Honestly, I felt ripped off.”</p>
<p>The agency is a particular point of pride for Trump, who has built 
his brand around glitz and glamour. “True Trumpologists know the model 
agency is only a tiny part of Trumpland financially,” <a href="http://www.nysun.com/business/business-of-beauty/3499/">the <em>New York Sun </em>wrote in 2004</a>.
 “But his agency best evokes a big Trump theme—sex sells.” Trump has 
often cross-pollinated his other business ventures with fashion models 
and has used them as veritable set pieces when he rolls out new 
products. Trump models, including Blais, appeared on <em>The Apprentice</em>—and they flanked him at the 2004 launch of his Parker Brothers board game, <em>TRUMP</em>.</p>
<p>Part of Blais’ job, she said, was to serve as eye candy at 
Trump-branded events. Recalling the first time she met the mogul, she 
said, “I had to go to the Trump Vodka opening.” It was a glitzy 2006 
gala at Trump Tower where Busta Rhymes performed, and Trump unveiled his
 (<a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/07/trump-files-watch-trump-vodka-ad-designed-russian-audience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soon-to-be-defunct</a>)
 line of vodka. “It was part of my duty to go and be seen and to be 
photographed and meet Donald Trump and shake his hand,” she remembered.</p>
<p>Trump made a strong impression on her that night. “I knew that I was a
 model and there was objectification in the job, but this was another 
level,” she said. Blais left Trump Model Management the year after the 
Trump Vodka gala, feeling that she had been exploited and shortchanged 
by the agency.</p>
<p>Kate, who went on to have a successful career with another agency, 
also parted ways with Trump’s company in disgust. “My overall experience
 was not a very good one,” she said. “I left with a bad taste in my 
mouth. I didn’t like the agency. I didn’t like where they had us living.
 Honestly, I felt ripped off.”</p>
<p>These days, Kate said, she believes that Trump has been fooling 
American voters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric, given that his own 
agency had engaged in the practices he has denounced. “He doesn’t like 
the face of a Mexican or a Muslim,” she said, “but because these 
[models] are beautiful girls, it’s okay? He’s such a hypocrite.”</p>
